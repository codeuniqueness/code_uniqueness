y1= y_{omega_0}
y2= y_{omega_8}
y3= y_{omega_{10}}
y4= y_{omega_{12}}
y5= y_{omega_{14}}
y6= y_{omega_{16}}
y7= y_{omega_{18}}
y8= y_{omega_{20}}

and in case of 22_8_11:
y9= y_{omega_{22}}  (For 22_8_10 there cannot be two words at distance 22, as the maximum possible distance for two words of weight 10 is 2*10=20.)

Here y_{omega_t} is as described in the paper.

The other y-variables are not important for our purposes (but a list can be obtained by running W234DEF.java).
